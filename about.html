    I am a cyber security engineer. I like to think of myself as a hybrid Software, DevOps, and Data Engineer with a focus on solving security challenges.

    I emjoy using automation tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Kubernetes. I also frequently use data engineering tools like Nifi, Kafka, Airflow, Trino, and many others. I love writing code in Ruby, but also frequently write Python, Java, and more. One day I shall be more comfortable in Rust.

    My blog may contain posts of many topics at at any time. Don't expect complete consistency :)
